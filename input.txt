Have you ever driven a car and wondered how it actually works? Under the hood, that is? Well, you don’t have to in order to drive a car and neither do you need to be able to re-create the code that computes the Secure Hash Algorithm II, or, in our case SHA-256, but it is definitely fun. I want to share with you the code in an attempt to motivate other beginners and more advanced developers to look behind the libraries that are so often used in any given programming language. Even though, needless to say, that these libraries are intended for production, while this implementation is not, so bear that in mind.

A beginner’s knowledge of Python should suffice. Math is not really required, but having knowledge of the different Basic Representations of data, i.e., converting characters to integers, Base 2 and Base 10 and Base16 conversions, is definitely an advantage, even though we will look into those as well.

The code is designed in such a way that it is easy to read and follow (e.g., little nesting or hardly any list comprehensions are utilized), and the lines in the code blocks are annotated, which I always find very helpful. Anyways, this should also allow you to skip all the explanations in-between and just take the code into account, if that’s what you prefer.
